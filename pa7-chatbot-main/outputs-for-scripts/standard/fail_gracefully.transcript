        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked Titanic (1997). Tell me more about it.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCan you specify your statement between ['Titanic (1997)', 'Titanic (1953)']?
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mSomething like: I've never heard of Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220), sorry... Tell me about another movie you liked.
> I loved zootopia

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not recognizing a movie title in what you said. Can you tell me about a film you've seen recently?
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCould you share details about one movie first? Feel free to start whenever you're ready.
> :quit

[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
