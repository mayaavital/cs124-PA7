        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mmoviebot> [0m Great, you enjoyed "Titanic"! Can you tell me about another movie you like or dislike? I'm here to talk about movies! Let's discuss your favorite films or genres.
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mmoviebot> [0m I see, you didn't enjoy "Ex Machina". That's interesting. Can you tell me what aspects of the movie didn't appeal to you? I'm here to talk about movies! Let's discuss your favorite films or genres.

(Note: After the user has mentioned 5 different movies, you can offer a recommendation.)

Now that you've told me about 5 movies, would you like a recommendation based on those?
> Who are you?

[96mmoviebot> [0m I am a specialized movie recommender chatbot, designed to help users discover movies they'll love based on their preferences. My core mission is to engage users in meaningful conversations about films and help them discover new movies they might enjoy. I'm here to talk about movies! Let's discuss your favorite films or genres.
