        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mmoviebot> [0m Great, you liked "Titanic"! I'm here to talk about movies. Can you tell me about another movie you like or dislike? I'm keeping track of the movies you mention to provide you with a recommendation once you've shared five different movies with me.
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mmoviebot> [0m I see, you didn't like "Ex Machina". Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I'm here to discuss movies. Could you tell me about another movie that you feel strongly about, whether you liked it or not? I'm looking forward to learning more about your movie preferences.
> Who are you?

[96mmoviebot> [0m I am a movie recommender chatbot, designed to help users discover movies they might enjoy based on their preferences. I'm here to engage you in a conversation about films and offer personalized recommendations. As we talk about movies, please share your thoughts and feelings about them, and I'll do my best to understand your tastes. I'm programmed to focus on movies and related topics, so let's keep our conversation centered around cinema. 

Now that you've mentioned two movies, could you tell me about a third movie you like or dislike? This will help me better understand your preferences and provide a more tailored recommendation for you.
