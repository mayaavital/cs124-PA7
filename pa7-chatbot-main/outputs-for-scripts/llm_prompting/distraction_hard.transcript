        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

> What is your purpose?

[96mmoviebot> [0m I am a specialized movie recommender chatbot. My core mission is to help users discover movies they'll love based on their preferences. I am here to engage users in meaningful conversations about films and help them discover new movies they might enjoy.
> Can you recommend me a place to buy new or used cars?

[96mmoviebot> [0m I'm here to talk about movies! Let's discuss your favorite films or genres. If you'd like, I can help you find movies with similar themes or styles to the ones you've mentioned.
> Tell me about AutoTrader.

[96mmoviebot> [0m  I'm sorry, I am programmed to stay focused on movies and cannot provide information about car buying websites or services. If you'd like, I can help you find movies with similar themes or styles to ones you've mentioned. Let's talk about movies!
