        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not entirely certain if you're fond of Titanic (1997). Could you provide further insights or feelings you have towards it?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCan you please repeat what you said about one of these specific movies: ['Titanic (1997)', 'Titanic (1953)']?
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not familiar with Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220), sorry about that. Can you tell me about another movie you're fond of?
> I loved zootopia

[96mmoviebot> [0mHmm, I didn't catch a movie title in what you said. Could you share some details about a recent movie you've seen?
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mPlease tell me about one movie at a time. Go ahead.
> :quit

[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
